# Firewall Configuration Example
# Copy this file to firewall_config.toml and customize as needed

[firewall]
# Choose your security mode:
# "aggressive" - High security, strict blocking
# "standard"   - Balanced security (recommended)
# "lenient"    - Relaxed for high-traffic environments
# "custom"     - Use custom settings below
mode = "standard"

# ============================================================================
# TRUSTED NETWORKS - CUSTOMIZE THESE FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================================================

[trusted]
# Add your trusted IP addresses (never blocked)
ips = [
    "127.0.0.1",        # Localhost
    "192.168.1.1",      # Your router/gateway
    # "10.0.0.100",     # Your admin workstation
    # "203.0.113.50",   # Your office public IP
]

# Add your trusted networks (CIDR notation)
networks = [
    "192.168.0.0/16",   # Home/office network
    "10.0.0.0/8",       # Corporate VPN
    # "172.16.0.0/12",  # Additional private range
]

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM SETTINGS (only used when mode = "custom")
# ============================================================================

[custom]
# Uncomment and modify these when using mode = "custom"
# unique_ports_threshold = 7        # Ports scanned before blocking
# default_port_threshold = 10       # Default attempts per port
# activity_window_hours = 2         # Tracking time window
# block_durations = ["10m", "2h", "1d", "7d"]  # Escalating penalties

[custom.port_thresholds]
# Uncomment and modify port-specific thresholds
# 80 = 2      # Web server
# 443 = 2     # HTTPS
# 22 = 3      # SSH
# 8000 = 10   # Development server

# ============================================================================
# QUICK SETUP EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================

# For small office (10-50 users):
# mode = "standard"

# For enterprise (1000+ employees):
# mode = "lenient"

# For development environment:
# mode = "lenient"

# For high security environment:
# mode = "aggressive"
