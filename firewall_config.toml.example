# Firewall Configuration Example
# Copy this file to firewall_config.toml and customize as needed

[firewall]
# Choose your security mode:
# "aggressive" - High security, strict blocking (30s state saves)
# "standard"   - Balanced security (2min state saves) [recommended]
# "lenient"    - Relaxed for high-traffic environments (5min state saves)
# "custom"     - Use custom settings below
mode = "standard"

# State file location (where tracking data is saved)
state_file = "firewall_state.toml"

# How often to check for expired IP blocks (seconds)
sleep_interval = 5

# Performance: State save intervals are automatic by mode:
# - aggressive: 30 seconds (minimal data loss risk)
# - standard: 120 seconds (balanced performance)
# - lenient: 300 seconds (maximum performance)
# For custom mode, override with: state_save_interval = 60

# Firewall operation mode:
# - "detection_only": Monitor attacks, allow all ports (default)
# - "firewall": Block unauthorized ports, full firewall replacement
# - "corporate": Strict port filtering for corporate environments
firewall_mode = "detection_only"

# TRUSTED NETWORKS - CUSTOMIZE THESE FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================================================

[trusted]
# Add your trusted IP addresses (never blocked)
ips = [
    "127.0.0.1",        # Localhost
    "192.168.1.1",      # Your router/gateway
    # "10.0.0.100",     # Your admin workstation
    # "203.0.113.50",   # Your office public IP
]

# Add your trusted networks (CIDR notation)
networks = [
    "192.168.0.0/16",   # Home/office network
    "10.0.0.0/8",       # Corporate VPN
    # "172.16.0.0/12",  # Additional private range
]

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM SETTINGS (only used when mode = "custom")
# ============================================================================

[custom]
# Uncomment and modify these when using mode = "custom"
# unique_ports_threshold = 7        # Ports scanned before blocking
# default_port_threshold = 10       # Default attempts per port
# activity_window_hours = 2         # Tracking time window
# block_durations = ["10m", "2h", "1d", "7d"]  # Escalating penalties

# Custom state save interval (seconds) - overrides mode defaults
# state_save_interval = 60          # Save every 60 seconds

[custom.port_thresholds]
# Uncomment and modify port-specific thresholds
# 80 = 2      # Web server
# 443 = 2     # HTTPS
# 22 = 3      # SSH
# 8000 = 10   # Development server

# ============================================================================
# QUICK SETUP EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================

# For small office (10-50 users):
# mode = "standard"

# For enterprise (1000+ employees, high traffic):
# mode = "lenient"

# For development environment:
# mode = "lenient"

# For high security environment:
# mode = "aggressive"

# For maximum performance (high traffic servers):
# mode = "custom"
# state_save_interval = 300  # 5 minutes

# ============================================================================
# FIREWALL PORT FILTERING (when firewall_mode = "firewall" or "corporate")
# ============================================================================

[allowed_ports]
# TCP ports that are allowed through the firewall
# Only these ports will accept connections in firewall/corporate mode
tcp = [
    22,    # SSH
    80,    # HTTP
    443,   # HTTPS
    # 3306,  # MySQL (uncomment if needed)
    # 5432,  # PostgreSQL (uncomment if needed)
    # 8000,  # Development server (uncomment if needed)
]

# Example configurations:

# Web server only:
# tcp = [22, 80, 443]

# Database server:
# tcp = [22, 3306, 5432]

# Development environment:
# tcp = [22, 80, 443, 8000, 8080, 3000]

# Corporate environment (minimal ports):
# tcp = [22, 80, 443]
# firewall_mode = "corporate"
